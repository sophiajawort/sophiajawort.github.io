                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>The Habit Tracking Tote bag was made to support a user in their efforts to break
                    a bad habit. The user can set a maximum goal to stay under for the day. Then, they
                    can press any key on the keypad when they perform their targeted bad habit, which will then
                    increase the count. Once the user has reached their max goal for the day a red led will turn 
                    on to notify them. By pressing * the user can reset the count to 0 and the red led will turn off.
                    The tote bag only accepts a new goal once everyday. If you reach your max daily goal the count resets
                    to 0 , but will notify you when you reach your set maximum for the day again.

                <p>I used a 220 ohm resistor for the led. The Red led needs at least 160 ohms of resistance. 220 > 160</p>

                <h3>Technical Writeup</h3>
                <p>To create this tote bag I used an arduino, wires, 220 ohm resistor, 5v power source, 
                    red led, membrane keypad, and some scrap fabric and thred to make the pocket enclosure.
                    Attach the led to pin 12 of your arduino. Attach the 8 wires of the keypad to pins 9-2. 

                    The membrane keypad accepts user input once daily. The user must enter a number and press '#' to
                    submit their input. Then they can click any button on the keypad to increase the count. When they have
                    pressed on the keypad the same number as their max goal a red led will turn on. Press '*' to turn
                    the led off and reset count. The daily goal will stay the same for 24 hours. See firmware comments above
                    for further explanation of logic. 

                    This was the second iteration of my project. My first iteration consisted of a push button and a red led.
                    The logic was similar, but I was trying to get input from a p5 server. I felt like the pushbutton was too
                    small of a target for the user to casually press, and I was having trouble with sending the correct number
                    from the server to the arduino. With my second iteration I was able to incapsulate the user input functionality
                    within the product.
